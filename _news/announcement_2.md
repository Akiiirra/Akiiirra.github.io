Research paper published in Cities

I'm pleased to share our recent paper on "Developing a multi-criteria prioritization tool to catalyze TOD on publicly owned land areas" published in Cities. Many thanks to the co-authors of this paper: Professor Arthur Acolin, Professor Anne Vernez Moudon, and Professor Qing Shen.

In this paper, we developed a multi-criteria TOD prioritization tool and tested it on selected park-and-ride sites owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. The resulting tool can be used to identify park-and-ride sites that are most suitable for TOD, as well as to prioritize other forms of publicly owned land that are potentially suitable for TOD.

The paper is accessible via the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275123004183">link</a>.
